# NetworksAPI
This is the Networks API Library based on that of Nart Schinackow Munoz and rewritten by valentinbreiz.

# Description
This is a networks api library built in C#, it facilitates the communication between any two devices that use TCP/IP transport protocol. through a simple event driven program you could build a multi threaded connection. For exemple you can see this https://github.com/valentinbreiz/Ode-Chat with an old precompiled api but perfectly work with that NetworksAPI.
This package contains the dll library all you need to do is import it to your project references.
You can find the .dll in \NetworksAPI\bin\Debug ;)
